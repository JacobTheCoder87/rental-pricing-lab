## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to utilize Jupyter Notebook and imported libraries, such as pandas, seaborn and sklearn linear regressions to analyze property prices in Taiwan. The goal is to analyze rental property prices in Taiwan based on distinct features, such as the distance to subway stations, the number of nearby convenience stores, and the age of the house.

## Project Description
This project comprises three main steps: exploration, cleaning, and prediction using our provided data. In the initial step, we delve into our raw data using tools like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and statistics to gain insights. Visual aids such as histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and heatmaps are employed to better understand the data. These visualizations guide us in identifying areas that require cleaning. Moving on to the second step, we focus on cleaning the data by addressing outliers, handling missing values, renaming columns, and removing irrelevant information such as latitude and longitude for each property, as well as eliminating quotes from strings. Finally, armed with our newly cleaned data, we construct a linear regression model to predict property prices based on key variables like distance to the subway, number of nearby convenience stores, and property age.

The hypothesis we are investigating is whether factors such as the distance to subway stations, house age, and the number of nearby convenience stores affect property prices. I firmly believe that these factors indeed exhibit a correlation with the property prices. We plan to delve extensively into this topic in our project.
